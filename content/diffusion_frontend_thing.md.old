# diffusion frontend thing

this project is a simple frontend for [animagine-xl-3.1](https://huggingface.co/cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.1) that i built, in order to test out a semantic tag correction system.

functionally the project uses an big embedding vector store of image tags, in order to automatically correct invalid image tags.

you can have a look at the code over on [github](https://github.com/e74000/diffusion_frontend_thing/)
