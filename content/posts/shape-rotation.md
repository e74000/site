# hypercube rotator

i wrote a few small toy programm a while ago when i was applying to oxford (got filtered) as part of my personal statement. this is one of those projects.

it is a simple visualiser that shows different projections of n-dimensional cubes and their rotations.

you can see a live demo for the project [here](https://r2.e74000.net/wasm/run.html?path=cube.wasm).

it is written in go using a combination of ebitengine, gonum and WASM
