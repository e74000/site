        <h1>About This Website</h1>
<p>I built this website using <a href="https://github.com/e74000/shizuka">shizuka</a>, a custom static site generator I wrote. Despite seeming like a pointless amount of effort to go to for making a small personal blog like this, I did this because I found stuff like Hugo and Jekyll annoying to use.</p>
<p>Shizuka is named after the character from 君のことが大大大大大好きな100人の彼女, on account of being small and doing lots of reading, much like the character.</p>
<p>The aim of writing Shizuka was to make something with the shortest possible installation -&gt; having a site time. For this reason it focuses on extreme simplicity over features. However, a core focus was to ensure that it remains our of the user's way when designing themes or making templates.</p>
<p>The focus on simplicity also means that I should be able to add new features pretty easily, for example embedding interactive programs in posts, nice link previews, etc.</p>
<h2>Try Shizuka!</h2>
<p>To install shizuka, just run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">go install github.com/e74000/shizuka@latest
</code></pre>
<p>You can then scaffold a new project into your current directory with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">shizuka init
</code></pre>
<p>And then start a development server with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">shizuka dev
</code></pre>
<p>And you are done! You can edit files, templates etc and the preview (should) hot-reload to preview your site.</p>
<p>When you want to deploy a site, just run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">shizuka build
</code></pre>
