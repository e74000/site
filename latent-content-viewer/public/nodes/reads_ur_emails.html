<h1 id="thing-that-reads-your-emails">thing that reads your emails</h1>

<p>so i realised a while ago that i am basically incapable of checking my emails...</p>

<p>instead of investing the (like a minute per day tops) effort required to actually look at my emails, i thought "why don't i spend like 17hrs writing an automatic email summarisation bot?"</p>

<p>you can see this project on <a href="https://github.com/e74000/reads_ur_emails">github</a></p>

<h1 id="what-it-does">what it does</h1>

<p><code>reads_ur_emails</code> periodically fetches your emails, generates a summary, and sends the summaries to specific discord channels.</p>

<h1 id="task-sheduler">task sheduler</h1>

<p>this is really just an openai wrapper strapped to a load of random apis, the only really novel thing in it is the task scheduler library lmao</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">how it works</h2>

<p>the scheduler takes a set of tasks, each of which can define their own timing rules. currently there are several predefined timing rules for it:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>once</em>: runs a task once.</li>
<li><em>every</em>: runs at a set interval.</li>
<li><em>random</em>: runs at a random inteval in a set range.</li>
<li><em>daily</em>: runs daily at a specific time.</li>
<li><em>weekly</em>: runs on specific days of the week at a set time.</li>
<li><em>monthly</em>: runs on specific months at a set day and time.</li>
</ul>

<p>there are also blocking modes that can be used to manage running multiple tasks concurrently</p>

<ul>
<li><em>non-blocking</em>: when this task is running, it doesn't prevent any other tasks (or instances of itself) from running.</li>
<li><em>blocking</em>: only one instance of this (type of) task can run at once, useful for very long lived tasks.</li>
<li><em>global blocking</em>: no other tasks can run while this task is running.</li>
</ul>

<p>it supports adding/deleting tasks, error handling including panics and logging (via <code>slog</code>)</p>

<p>i thought it was kind of neat so i might make it into its own library at some point. if you want to use it, drop me a dm on twitter and i can move it into its own package.</p>
