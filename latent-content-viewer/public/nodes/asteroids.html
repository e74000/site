<h1 id="relativistic-asteroids">relativistic asteroids</h1>

<p>this project is combines an (approximate) relatavistic physics engine with the arcade game asteroids.</p>

<p>features inclue:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>relativistic physics engine: this game is built on a modified verlet integration physics + collision solver, it includes things like time dilation and length contraction. as your ship approaches the speed of light, the game world behaves differently.</p></li>
<li><p>dynamic speed of light: the speed of light (c) in the engine isn't a fixed value. it can (and is) be dynamically altered during gameplay.</p></li>
<li><p>collisions: collisions between asteroids, bullets, and your ship are handled using a lorentz-corrected collision detection algorithm. the engine attempts to account for relativistic momentum and energy conservation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>you can try out a demo of this <a href="https://r2.e74000.net/wasm/run.html?path=asteroids.wasm">here</a>.</p>
