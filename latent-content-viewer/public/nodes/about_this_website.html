<h1 id="about-this-website">about this website</h1>

<p>i built this website out of two main parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>the frontend, built using svelte/three.js/tailwind,</li>
<li>the static site generator, written in python,</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="frontend">frontend</h2>

<p>the frontend is an interactive node viewer, representing the semantic positions of each piece of media, and the connections between them.</p>

<p>yellow nodes represent text posts, while blue nodes represent images.</p>

<p>i think it's still a little buggy on mobile, but it is mostly working at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="generator">generator</h2>

<p>the static site generator is used to embed the posts into a semantic embedding space using CLIP, before using UMAP to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings so they can be viewed in 3d.</p>

<p>it also extracts metadata from the media, such as links and tags, and converts the markdown documents into HTML.</p>

<p>there's not really much point to doing this, but i thought it was neat so i did it anyway.</p>

<h2 id="roadmap">roadmap</h2>

<ul>
<li>i want to start doing some more photography/art again, and post that stuff here too.</li>
</ul>
