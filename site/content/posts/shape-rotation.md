# Hypercube Rotator

I wrote a few small toy program a while ago when I was applying to Oxford (got filtered by the interview lmao ;_;) as part of my personal statement. This is one of those projects.

It is a simple visualiser that shows different projections of n-dimensional cubes and their rotations.

You can see a live demo for the project [here](https://r2.e74000.net/wasm/run.html?path=cube.wasm).
