# relativistic asteroids

i wrote a few small toy programs a while ago when i was applying to oxford (got filtered) as part of my personal statement. this is one of those projects.

this project is combines an (approximate) relativistic physics engine with a clone of the retro arcade game asteroids.

i wrote it in go with ebitengine and WASM.

you can try out a demo of this [here](https://r2.e74000.net/wasm/run.html?path=asteroids.wasm). (probably borked i can't lie)
