# relativistic asteroids

I wrote a few small toy program a while ago when I was applying to Oxford (got filtered by the interview lmao ;_;) as part of my personal statement. This is one of those projects.

This project is combines an (approximate) relativistic physics engine with a clone of the retro arcade game asteroids.

You can try out a demo of this [here](https://r2.e74000.net/wasm/run.html?path=asteroids.wasm). (It has been a while since I took a look at this, might be a bit buggy)
