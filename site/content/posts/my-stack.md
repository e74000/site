# my stack  

this is my "personal stack" — a collection of tools, habits, and things i rely on to keep myself sane. it's by no means a list of recommendations, just what i happen to use.  

---

## software  
- *os:* macOS & Arch Linux with i3. macOS is my daily driver, but i have arch on my PC for when i'm feeling particularly bored.  
- *editor:* primarily goland and micro (i don't actually like micro much, i just cba to move to nvim right now).  
- *terminal+shell:* kitty with zsh.
- *organisation:* apple notes/calendar for literally everything lol (my todo list is called '[tu-tu-ru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVtXKkc2hYo) list').  
- *notes:* i take notes in obsidian, using the "latex suite" and "extended mathjax" plugins to make my life slightly easier.  
- *browser:* brave, of course.  

(i'll probably put dotfiles etc up here at some point when i get a chance)

## hardware  
- *laptop:* 14" m2 macbook air
- *keyboard:* ZSA Moonlander.  
- *headphones:* nothing ear (a).  
- *watch:* custom modded Casio F-91W with inverted display and nato strap.  
- *bike:* Trek Remedy 7 with CushCore tyre inserts.

## wetware  
this isn’t medical advice; it’s just what works for me lol  
- *NAC (2400mg weekdays):* helps with excoriation disorder and mood stabilization.  
- *zinc (30mg daily):* offsets NAC’s zinc depletion.  
- *vitamin D:* because winter in the UK sucks lmao.  

past experiments:
- *magnesium:* didn’t notice much benefit, so i stopped bothering.  
- *5-methylfolate:* same deal as magnesium.  
- *phosphatidyl serine:* does help with stress somewhat, but it’s kind of prohibitively expensive for any real benefit.  

future experiments:
- *D-serine:* this looks very interesting as an NMDA antagonist.

## psychoware  
- *music:* i really love techno, especially Tzusing, Panther Modern, and Hiro Kone. i also like lots of other genres, like trip hop, city pop, and dnb/jungle.  
- *cooking:* i make omurice *possibly* too often. i also enjoy making fajitas and yakiudon. i'm always up for learning to cook new things. banh mi is currently my next goal.
- *anime:* recently on a sad anime binge (*Your Name,* *A Silent Voice,* *5 Centimeters Per Second*).  
- *drinks:* i love nice coffee and matcha. i have an aeropress and a proper matcha set for making great drinks.
- *art:* i have a slight obsession with pylons, so i take lots of photos of pylons, and adjacent stuff (please dm me pictures of pylons lmfao). i also make glitch art. real ones know that i used to make music too.
- *sports:* i'm a massive adrenaline junkie therefore i really love mountain biking. i also climb frequently, and i want to get back into BMXing at some point.
