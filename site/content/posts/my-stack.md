# my stack  

this is my "personal stack" — a collection of tools, habits, and things i rely on to keep myself sane. it's by no means a list of recommendations, just what i happen to use.  

---

## software  
- **os:** macOS & Arch Linux with i3. macOS is my daily driver, but i have arch on my PC for when i'm feeling particularly bored.  
- **editor:** primarily goland and micro (i don't actually like micro much, i just cba to move to nvim right now).  
- **terminal+shell:** kitty with zsh.
- **organisation:** apple notes/calendar for literally everything lol (my todo list is called '[tu-tu-ru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVtXKkc2hYo) list').  
- **notes:** i take notes in obsidian, using the "latex suite" and "extended mathjax" plugins to make my life slightly easier.  
- **browser:** brave, of course.  

(i'll probably put dotfiles etc up here at some point when i get a chance)

## hardware  
- **keyboard:** ZSA Moonlander.  
- **headphones:** nothing ear (a).  
- **watch:** custom modded Casio F-91W with inverted display and nato strap.  
- **bike:** Trek Remedy 7 with CushCore tyre inserts.

## biological  
this isn’t medical advice; it’s just what works for me lol  
- **NAC (2400mg weekdays):** helps with excoriation disorder and mood stabilization.  
- **zinc (30mg daily):** offsets NAC’s zinc depletion.  
- **vitamin D:** because winter in the UK sucks lmao.  

**past experiments:**  
- **magnesium:** didn’t notice much benefit, so i stopped bothering.  
- **5-methylfolate:** same deal as magnesium.  
- **phosphatidyl serine:** does help with stress somewhat, but it’s kind of prohibitively expensive for any real benefit.  

**future experiments:**  
- **D-serine:** this looks very interesting as an NMDA antagonist.

## habits  
- **music:** i really love techno, especially Tzusing, Panther Modern, and Hiro Kone. i also like lots of other genres, like trip hop, city pop, and jungle.  
- **cooking:** i make omurice *possibly* too often. i also like making fajitas and yakiudon.  
- **anime:** recently on a sad anime binge (*Your Name,* *A Silent Voice,* *5 Centimeters Per Second*).  
- **drinks:** i love nice coffee and matcha. i have an aeropress and a proper matcha set for making great drinks.
